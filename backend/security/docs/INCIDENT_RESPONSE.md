## Incident Response Phases

### 1. Detection and Analysis

#### Detection Sources
- Security monitoring alerts (SIEM, IDS/IPS)
- Anomaly detection systems
- User reports
- Audit log analysis
- Vulnerability scanners
- External notifications (security researchers, customers)

#### Initial Assessment
1. Verify the incident is genuine (not false positive)
2. Determine the scope and impact
3. Classify severity level
4. Activate incident response team
5. Begin documentation

#### Documentation
Create incident ticket with:
- Incident ID
- Date/time detected
- Detection source
- Initial assessment
- Severity classification
- Affected systems/data
- Timeline of events

### 2. Containment

#### Short-term Containment
**Immediate Actions (within 15 minutes):**
- Isolate affected systems
- Block suspicious IP addresses
- Disable compromised accounts
- Enable additional logging
- Preserve evidence

**Example Commands:**
```bash
# Block suspicious IP
iptables -A INPUT -s <suspicious-ip> -j DROP

# Disable compromised user account
./scripts/disable-user.sh user-123

# Isolate compromised container
kubectl cordon <node-name>
kubectl delete pod <compromised-pod>

# Enable debug logging
kubectl set env deployment/<app> LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

#### Long-term Containment
**Within 1-4 hours:**
- Apply temporary patches
- Implement workarounds
- Enhance monitoring
- Conduct deeper investigation
- Plan for recovery

### 3. Eradication

**Remove the threat:**
1. Identify root cause
2. Remove malware/backdoors
3. Close vulnerabilities
4. Remove unauthorized access
5. Clean affected systems

**Actions:**
```bash
# Scan for malware
clamscan -r /path/to/scan

# Remove unauthorized SSH keys
./scripts/audit-ssh-keys.sh

# Patch vulnerabilities
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
npm audit fix

# Reset compromised credentials
./scripts/rotate-credentials.sh

# Rebuild compromised systems
terraform destroy -target=<resource>
terraform apply
```

### 4. Recovery
